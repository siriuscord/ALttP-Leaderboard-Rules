CATEGORY RULES
-------------------------

1) RAM Preparation is allowed, and therefore, starting the run WITHOUT a hard/soft reset is also allowed.

3) An input display is preferred but not required.

MAJOR GLITCHES BLACKLIST
-------------------------

This ruleset is meant to be very unrestrictive to allow use of most glitches. However, a few things which are extremely powerful are banned, so as not to remove too much actual gameplay from speedruns.
 
The following techniques are banned in MG categories:
* Arbitrary Code Execution
	* Causing the game to execute values from memory as code/instructions.
* Arbitrary Memory Writes
	* Out of Bounds Misslotting:
		* Misslotting an ancilla to any "slot" higher than 9, or less than 0 (not currently possible)
		* Any ancilla created must have its ID written to an address between $7E0C4A and $7E0C53, inclusive.
	* EG2 Out of Bounds Writes
		* Transferring room data to room IDs on the secondary underworld map (EG2), besides those belonging to properly defined rooms
		* Specifically, having your room ID become any value in the range $128 and $1FF, inclusive, by any means, is banned.
